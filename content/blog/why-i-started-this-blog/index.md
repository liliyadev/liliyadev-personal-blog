Iâ€™ve always believed that creativity thrives when itâ€™s shared. For a long time, Iâ€™ve been quietly building, learning, and experimentingâ€”whether itâ€™s with code, design, or ideas. But I realized: whatâ€™s the point of creating if it never sees the light of day?

This blog is my way of stepping out of the shadows and into the open. Iâ€™ll be sharing my journey as a developer, the tools Iâ€™m exploring (hello Gatsby and Tailwind!), and the lessons I learn along the way. Expect a mix of tutorials, reflections, and maybe even a few rants when things break and I have no idea why ðŸ˜…

Iâ€™m not here to be perfect. Iâ€™m here to be real.

If youâ€™re reading this, thank you. Whether youâ€™re a fellow dev, a curious visitor, or just someone who stumbled inâ€”Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here.

Letâ€™s build something beautiful together.

â€” Liliya
